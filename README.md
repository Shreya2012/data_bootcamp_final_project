**Background:**

The outbreak of Corona Virus pandemic is provoking havoc - explosion of viruses and its variants, millions of lost lives, economic depths of despair and restraints on human interaction causing perceptible disruption, all over the globe. One such undesirable outcome is on the psychological health of populace at large. Scientists & researchers, apprehend the deterioration of mental health caused by COVID isn’t temporary, and could persist long after the pandemic departs. Suddenly, innumerable people are suffering from stress, fear, anxiety, trepidation, hopelessness and ultimately depression. Closely monitoring mental health trends in real-time, can help people that are disproportionately affected and hence the study becomes extremely crucial. These trends can also be used to assess and compute the impact of policies and endeavors that address mental health status. Microblogging platforms like twitter have come to the fore as a space of trends. Tweets (twitter posts) are perspectives, views, comments on international, political, social trends, dispositions, and ongoing issues. They say, “You are what you Tweet”. Indeed, people are using this platform to unload the burdens of mental health. With this notion in mind, following is an analytical study of “Discovering Mental Health in micro bloggers”.

**Problem Statement:**

Has the mental health of populace in COVID deteriorated?
What is the proportion of people experiencing symptoms of anxiety and depression?
Are more people anxious than depressed or vice-versa?
With how much certainty can we predict the mental health of a person by using his history of tweets?
